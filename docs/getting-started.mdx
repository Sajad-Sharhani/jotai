Welcome to the Jotai Getting Started tutorial!
This tutorial will introduce you to Jotai and teach you how to start using it correctly.

For this tutorial, we assume that you're using Jotai with React. The example is based on [a Create-React-App folder structure](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure) so the first thing you have to do is:

`npx create-react-app my-app`

## Installation
To install the latest stable version of Jotai, run the following command:

`npm install jotai` or `yarn add jotai`

## Provider

Provider is to provide a state for component sub tree.
This works just like the normal React Context.
A good place to put this is in your root component:

```jsx
import { Provider, atom, useAtom } from 'jotai'

const App = () => (
  <Provider>
    <Input />
    <CharCount />
    <Uppercase />
  </Provider>
)

export default App
```

We'll implement the components mentioned above in the following section.

## atom

There's an exported function called `atom` that comes with jotai, which represents a piece of state. Atoms can be read from and written to from any component.

To create an atom, all you need is to pass an initial value.

```jsx
const textAtom = atom('hello')
const textLenAtom = atom((get) => get(textAtom).length)
const uppercaseAtom = atom((get) => get(textAtom).toUpperCase())
```
In the code above, beside creating sample atom we also created derived atom, which called Read-only atom pattern.
For more detailed information about atom, We do recommend you to read [Primitives](https://jotai.org/docs/basics/primitives) section of the documentation.

## useAtom

The `useAtom` hook is to read an atom value in the state.
The `useAtom` function returns the atom value and an updating function as a tuple,
just like React's `useState`.

Now that we understand main idea behand Jotai, let's create the components we mentioned above:

```jsx
const Input = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useAtom(textAtom)
  return <input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
}

const CharCount = () => {
  const [len] = useAtom(textLenAtom)
  return <div>Length: {len}</div>
}

const Uppercase = () => {
  const [uppercase] = useAtom(uppercaseAtom)
  return <div>Uppercase: {uppercase}</div>
}
```
