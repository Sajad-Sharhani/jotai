Welcome to the Jotai Getting Started tutorial!
This tutorial will introduce you to Jotai and teach you how to use it correctly.
By creating a sample counter app!!


For this tutorial, we assume that you're using Jotai with React. For creating the react app, we will use [ Create-React-App ](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started), so the first thing you have to do is:

`npx create-react-app my-app`

## Installation
To install the latest stable version of Jotai, run the following command:

`npm install jotai` or `yarn add jotai`

## Provider

The first thing that comes to our minds regarding state management is that we need first to wrap our application with Provider to provide a state for the component subtree.
But what distinguishes Jotai from other state management is that it supports something called provider-less mode in which you don't need to wrap your components with a provider wrapper.
for more details consider reading [Primitives](https://jotai.org/docs/basics/primitives) section.

## atom

An exported function called `atom` comes with jotai, which represents a piece of state. Atoms can be read from and written to from any component.

To create an atom, all you need is to pass an initial value.

```jsx
import { atom, useAtom } from 'jotai'

function Counter() {
const countAtom = atom(0);
}
```

## useAtom

The `useAtom` hook reads an atom value in the state.
The `useAtom` function returns the atom value and an updating function as a tuple,
just like React's `useState`.

Now that we understand the main idea behind Jotai, let's create the components:
```jsx
function Counter() {
const countAtom = atom(0);

const [count, setCount] = useAtom(countAtom);
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{count} </h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((value) => value + 1)}>one up</button>
			<button onClick={() => setCount((value) => value - 1)}>one down</button>
    </>
  );
}

const App = () => (
  <>
    <Counter />
  </>
);

export default App;

```

We created a sample atom in the example above, but we can also create a derived atom.
For more detailed information about the atom, we recommend reading [Primitives](https://jotai.org/docs/basics/primitives) section of the documentation.

If you want to see more complex examples, we highly recommend seeing [Showcase](https://jotai.org/docs/basics/showcase) section of the documentation.
